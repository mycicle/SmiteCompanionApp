OK so what is the objective

 a middle server to wrap some of the less desirable features of the smite API
 which means we need to make the smite requests once manually, but the interface does not have to be extensible, efficient, or pretty

def getgods

def createsession

def getitems

those are the three requests we need to make

now the other end of this is the sqlite part, we are using sqlite as a quick and dirty startpoint for all of our needs

def persistgods

def persistitems

for the images we will have to see how they are returned, if they are normal web requests then we can just pass the URLs thorugh

now for the next part we can mimic smite endpoints

/getgods
def getpersistedgods

/getitems
def getpersisteditems
